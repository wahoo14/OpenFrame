# OpenFrame

This is an app I wrote to turn an Android device into a digital picture frame.  After previous mishaps with PYQt5 and an attempt to utilize storage on an external SD card, this verions works to display photos (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) stored on the device's internal memory.  For tools to transfer photos between the Android device and a Mac or PC, I recommend using OpenMTP (https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/).
