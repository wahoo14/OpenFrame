# OpenFrame

This is an app I wrote to turn an Android device into a digital picture frame.  After previous mishaps with PYQt5 and an attempt to utilize storage on an external SD card, this verions works to display photos (.png, .jpg, .jpeg) stored on the device's internal memory.  For tools to transfer photos between the Android device and a Mac or PC, I recommend using OpenMTP (https://openmtp.ganeshrvel.com/).

When the app first launches, it will display a completely black screen.  This is a known bug.  To work around, hit the Options button on your Android device as depicted in the below screenshot to display all of the apps currently running on your device.  Reselect OpenFrame and the app will display appropriately.

The Mobile_Version branch contains the OpenFrame_Kivy folder which is currently a 1.0 release with Android .apk file.
